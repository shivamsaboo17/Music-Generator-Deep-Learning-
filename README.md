## Dive right in!
`git clone https://github.com/shivamsaboo17/Music-Generator-Deep-Learning-/`</br>
`python predict.py`</br>
#### You now have an output midi file ready to be played on VLC / *any media player*<br><br>
## Training your own model
#### Add .midi files to the data folder. Try to put .midi of one instrument only during the training.
`python lstm.py`<br><br>
More the data, better is the output!!
You can stop training at any epoch. The weights untill the previous epoch will be saved automatically.
